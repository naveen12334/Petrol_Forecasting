# Problem Statement:
The ONGCF is a organisation dedicated to the exploration and production of oil and
natural gas. Price information is supplied on a weekly basis. It seeks to forecast crude
oil prices for the following 16 months, from January 1, 2019 to April 1, 2020.

# Goal:
The main goal is to predict the forecast the prices based upon the best model as per
your choice.

# Approach:
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

# Dataset:

# Project Various Steps:
# Data Exploration
I started exploring datasets using pandas, NumPy,matplotlib and seaborn.

# Data visualization:
Ploted colleration matrix to get insights about dependend and independed variables. Made chats like( Bocxplot,countplot,distplot,pairplot).

# Model Selection:
Build many Models like ARIMA,SARIMAX But selected FBPROPHET.

# Deployment :
Deployed on AWS cloud Platform.
